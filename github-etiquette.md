# Rules

Please keep file paths short and sensible

Please do not use funky characters or spaces in file names, as these cause problems due to Mac/Windows differences

Please always pull before you push in case somebody has done work since the last time you pulled- you may then lose somebody's work and have to resolve coding conflicts

Thank you!
